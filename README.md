Baseball Analysis
-----------------

In this project, I will analyse historical baseball data.
This is being done as a final project for the Udacity Intro to Data Analysis course - https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud170

Question: Is there a correlation between age and performance?
- Age will be an approximation. It will be calculated as the year of birth of the player subtracted from the year of the performance.
- Performance will be measured using the Batting, Pitching and Fielding Table.
