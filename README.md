Baseball Analysis
-----------------

## Overview
In this project, I will analyse historical baseball data.
This is being done as a final project for the Udacity Intro to Data Analysis course - https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170

The historical baseball data was taken from http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/ .
A description of the tables available in the data set can be seen in the readme2016.txt file. The actual data set is the baseballdatabank-2017.1.zip file.

## Question
Question: Is there a correlation between age and performance?
- Age will be an approximation. It will be calculated as the year of birth of the player subtracted from the year of the performance.
- To start, performance will be measured using the number of Runs from the Batting Table.

## Analysis
Open the Baseball.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to look at the detailed analysis.
